I'll add a short todo plan to track the analysis and next steps.

Created 4 todos

Progress: todo list created and analysis started.

**Context**: comparing pedagogy & assessment for courses with L-T-P = (3-0-0 + 0-0-1) vs (1-1-1).

**Assumptions**
- (3-0-0 + 0-0-1) = three lecture hours/week + separate 1-hour lab/week (lecture-heavy with one lab slot).
- (1-1-1) = one lecture, one tutorial, one lab per week (integrated contact & practice each week).
- Goal: evaluate learning design, assessment fit, scalability, and fit with dual-level (awareness/advanced) strategy.

**Analysis — Pedagogy**

- **Contact rhythm**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Lecture-heavy blocks concentrate concept delivery; lab isolated as application slot. Suits content-dense theory that benefits from long exposition.
  - **1-1-1:** Regular spaced practice (lecture → tutorial → lab) each week reinforces retrieval, immediate practice, and formative correction.

- **Learning modes**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Passive→active split: passive knowledge intake then delayed activity. Risk: weak transfer if lab delayed or crowded.
  - **1-1-1:** Immediate enactment of ideas in tutorial/lab supports active learning, error-correction, and scaffolding.

- **Depth vs Breadth**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Easier to cover breadth and dense theory; hard to sustain hands-on depth in limited lab hours.
  - **1-1-1:** Encourages incremental depth; better for skill acquisition (coding, debugging, small projects).

- **Student types**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Efficient for large cohorts and lecture-focused learners; risky for low-prep students who need repeated practice.
  - **1-1-1:** Better for mixed-ability cohorts; tutorials provide tailored remediation and challenge.

- **Instructor practice**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Prep-heavy lectures; labs require separate planning/TA support.
  - **1-1-1:** Requires closer coordination across lecture/tutorial/lab; higher recurring workload but more immediate feedback loops.

**Analysis — Assessment**

- **Formative opportunities**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Fewer frequent formative tasks unless explicitly added; lab can supply one graded practical per week but scheduling limits frequency.
  - **1-1-1:** High-frequency low-stakes assessments (tutorial quizzes, lab checkpoints) easier to integrate.

- **Summative alignment**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Summative often lecture-exam heavy; practical may be a small component—risk of misaligned priorities.
  - **1-1-1:** Summative can balance theory and practice naturally; easier to assign meaningful weight to continuous assessment.

- **Measuring advanced outcomes**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Harder to capture advanced, higher-order skills within limited lab time unless extra assignments/studios added.
  - **1-1-1:** Better platform to embed advanced tasks in tutorials/labs and track progression (supports dual-level tagging).

- **Scalability & fairness**
  - **3-0-0 + 0-0-1:** Scales for large lectures; fairness depends on standardised lab assessments and robust rubrics.
  - **1-1-1:** More grading load but improved diagnostic fairness through continuous assessment.

**Fit with Dual-Level Strategy (Awareness / Advanced)**

- **3-0-0 + 0-0-1**
  - Works for awareness floor (clear exposition), but requires extra mechanisms (studios, optional workshops, portfolios) to deliver advanced ceiling without creating inequity.
  - Recommended: keep core lecture for floor; attach optional studio (as in pilot) for advanced projects and portfolio evidence.

- **1-1-1**
  - Naturally supports dual-level tagging: tutorials/labs can host both floor practice and advanced extensions in the same weekly rhythm.
  - Recommended: design tutorial/lab tasks explicitly with floor vs ceiling markers; use formative checks to gate advanced tasks.

**Practical Recommendations**

- For placement-critical programming (DSA/DBMS/OOP):
  - Prefer **1-1-1** where possible—it improves weekly practice, supports project-based learning, and eases embedding advanced tasks.
  - If institutional constraints force **3-0-0 + 0-0-1**, mandate a scheduled, recurring advanced studio (opt-in) and require mapping of lab activities to course COs with floor/ceiling tags in §3/§14.

- Assessment design:
  - Use a mix: 40–60% continuous assessment (tutorials/labs/mini-projects), 40–60% summative (midterm+final) depending on course aims.
  - Make at least one instrument (lab project or studio deliverable) explicitly contribute to the Advanced marks bucket (§14).
  - Maintain identical core summative exam for fairness if parallel streams used; capture extra work via portfolio/badge as non-grade signals.

- Rubrics & calibration:
  - Publish rubrics that distinguish **awareness** (correctness, basic competence) vs **advanced** (architectural reasoning, optimization, testing).
  - Run a §14.1 calibration check to ensure awareness-only performance maps below the 8-CGPA threshold as intended.

**Quick Implementation Steps**
- If converting a 3-0-0 course to 1-1-1 pilot for DSA/DBMS/OOP, propose:
  - Reduce lecture to 1 hour, add 1-hour tutorial focused on worked problems, retain 1-hour lab for implementation.
  - Update course template (Course_File_Template_DualLevel.md) §11 session plan to show weekly lecture/tutorial/lab triplet and mark floor/ceiling entries.
  - Align assessment weights and add portfolio rubric and badge criteria.

## **DSA Example**

Sample assessment breakdown — DSA

1) For L-T-P = 3-0-0 + 0-0-1 (lecture-heavy + single lab)
- Continuous assessment: 45%
  - Weekly short quizzes / problem sets: 15% (5–8 low-stakes quizzes; best N counted)
  - Lab practicals / checkpoints: 15% (4 labs / checkpoints, rubric-scored)
  - Mini-project (individual): 15% (small system: e.g., heap-based priority queue with tests)
- Summative exams: 55%
  - Midterm (theory + small problems): 25%
  - Final (theory + larger problems): 30%

2) For L-T-P = 1-1-1 (lecture + tutorial + lab weekly)
- Continuous assessment: 55%
  - Weekly tutorial quizzes / problem sheets: 20% (higher frequency)
  - Lab assignments (incremental code tasks): 20% (weekly checkpoints)
  - Mini-project (paired/small team): 15%
- Summative exams: 45%
  - Midterm: 20%
  - Final: 25%

Notes:
- For pilot parallel-stream model, keep the same exam across streams. Advanced stream’s extra work is captured via portfolio/badge (see rubric below) and one project instrument marked as Advanced-contribution in §14.
- Suggested final weighting can be tuned to placement goals; ensure continuous assessment includes at least one instrument tied to Advanced marks (portfolio/project).

Rubrics (concise, useable templates)

A. Exam problem rubric (applies to midterm/final problems)
- Criteria (per problem, total 10 pts):
  - Correctness & completeness: 6 pts (full correct solution)
  - Algorithmic complexity and reasoning: 2 pts (explain time/space complexity)
  - Explanation & edge-case handling: 1 pt (discuss edge cases)
  - Clarity of steps/pseudocode: 1 pt (readable, structured)
- Partial-credit guidelines:
  - Correct approach but bug: 60–80% of correctness points.
  - Correct algorithm but missing complexity: full correctness, 0 for complexity.

B. Tutorial / Quiz rubric (5–10 pts per item)
- Correct answer: 3–4 pts
- Working / reasoning shown: 1–2 pts
- Partial credit: awarded for correct steps toward solution.

C. Lab assignment rubric (per assignment, 20–30 pts)
- Functionality / correctness (automated tests pass): 12 pts
- Robustness / edge-case handling: 4 pts
- Code quality & style (readability, modularity): 4 pts
- Tests & documentation (README with usage): 3 pts
- Timeliness & submission format: 1 pt

D. Mini-project rubric (individual/team, 100 pts)
- Core functionality / correctness: 40 pts

- Iteration evidence (issues, fixes, performance improvements): 15 pts
- Reflection & lessons learned: 10 pts
- Recruiter-readiness (one-page summary + demo): 15 pts
Scale to 100; threshold for "high-quality" portfolio = 75+

Badge: “Depth Certified — DSA”
- Badge criteria (all must be met):
  1. Pass core course (exam-based threshold met).
  2. Complete mini-project with score ≥ 70% (mini-project rubric).
  3. Portfolio artifact passing threshold (≥ 75%).
  4. Facilitator confirmation of active participation (attendance & deliverables).
- Badge logistics:
  - Badge recorded in placement portal; optional LinkedIn credential (via digital badge provider).
  - Badge does not change CGPA; placement office uses badge to prioritise interview slots.

Calibration & fairness safeguards
- Ensure exam content maps explicitly to awareness outcomes (tag problems as Awareness vs Advanced).
- §14.1 calibration: verify that a student who demonstrates only Awareness-level mastery maps below the 8-CGPA threshold.
- Provide a mid-semester crossover invitation: top performers in Awareness stream are invited to join Advanced cohort (mitigates self-selection bias).
- Use anonymised grading or standardised autograding for labs/quizzes to reduce bias.

Quick deliverables I can produce now (pick one)
- (1) A ready-to-drop `DSA_Assessment_Breakdown.md` file with the full tables and rubrics.
- (2) A `mini-project` scaffold (README + starter repo structure + simple autograder tests).
- (3) A `badge-rubric.yml` machine-readable badge spec for integration with a badge provider.

Which deliverable do you want next?
